title: Preparing Capital One Interview
---

Today is my 1 year working anniversary at current company. To celebrate, I decide to start prepare the interview of Data Scientists at Capital One. I interviewed with Capital One sometime in 2017. Unfortunately, my first attempt didn't work out. The interview typically consists of four steps: coding test, phone screen, data challenge and on-site interview. 

1. Coding test

Hackerrank test. 4 questions, 2 hours. This round is not very hard. The questions are simpler than leetcode easy questions. 


2. Phone screen

I failed the phone screen round last time. After spent some time searching around I found some useful posts: [yoyoinwanderland](https://yoyoinwanderland.github.io/Interview-Capital-One/) is a great summary of common ML/DS questions with answers, and [a medium post](https://medium.com/acing-ai/capital-one-data-science-interview-questions-b6263d8a3af6), a list of C1 frequently asked questions.

3. Data Challenge


4. On-site
